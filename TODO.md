# TODO
- write tests
- finish documentation
- Include go report in readme (and fix issues that it reports beforehand)
- add orbit fmt cmd for .orbit files
- disconnect session after TTL?
- rework sample (it is more of a test right now, would be nicer if the simple one shows the minimal needed setup, and a full one almost all of the features available)
