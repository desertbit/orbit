# TODO
- add maxmsgsize to calls (and streams?), but optional!!! take config value as default.
- write tests
- finish documenting
- update the comments and remove unneeded parts (like old pkg).
- Include go report in readme (and fix issues that it reports beforehand)
- add orbit fmt cmd for .orbit files
- disconnect session after TTL?
- use tls.dialContext in yamux, once the new go version has come out
